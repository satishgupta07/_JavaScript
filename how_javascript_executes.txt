How Javascript Works and Execution Context?

When the javascript code run, a Global Execution Context is created.

Everything in Javascript happens inside an execution context.
Execution Context is a container where whole javascript code is executed.

Execution Context has two components:
1)Memory Component - Memory Component is also known as Variable Environment
2)Code Component - Code Component is also known as Thread of Execution

⭐In Memory component all the variables and functions are stored
as a key-value pairs.**
⭐In Code Component code are executed one line at a time.

Note:Javascript is a Synchronous single Threaded Language
    *Synchronous means in order.
    *Single Threaded means one command processes at a time.


“Call Stack Maintains the order of execution of Execution Context”
