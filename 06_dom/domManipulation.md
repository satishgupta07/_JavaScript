## Definition of the DOM and Basic concepts

The DOM in dom manipulation in javascript stands for Document Object Model. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like structure illustrating the hierarchical relationship between various HTML elements. It can be easily explained as a tree of nodes generated by the browser. Each node has unique properties and methods that can be changed using JavaScript.

## How to Select Elements in the DOM
getElementById: returns an element whose id matches a passed string. Since the ids of elements are unique, this is the fastest way to select an element.
getElementsByTagName: returns a collection of all the elements present in the document that have the specified tag name, in the order of their appearance in the document.
getElementsByClassName: returns an HTMLCollection of elements that match the passed class name. Bypassing the class names separated by whitespace, we can search for multiple class names.
getElementsByName: returns a NodeList Collection of the elements that match the value of the name attribute with the passed string.
querySelector: returns the very first element within the document that matches the given selector. It only returns the element that matches with one of the specified CSS selectors, or a group of selectors.
querySelectorAll: returns a static NodeList of elements that matches with one or a group of selectors. If no element matches, an empty NodeList is returned.
